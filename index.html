  <h2>Pen</h2>
  <p>A pen is a common writing instrument used to apply ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. Historically, reed pens, quill pens, and dip pens were used, with a nib dipped in ink Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used.Modern types include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain and felt or ceramic tip pens.</p></section></div>

  <h2>Paper</h2>
  <p style="color: #ccff13;">Paper is a thin sheet material produced by mechanically and/or chemically processing cellulose fibres derived from wood, rags, grasses or other vegetable sources in water, draining the water, draining the water through fine mesh leaving the fibre evenly distributed on the surface, followed by pressing and drying. Although paper was originally made in single sheets by hand, almost all is now made on large machinesâ€”some making reels 10 metres wide, running at 2,000 metres per minute and up to 600,000 tonnes a year.</p></section></div>
